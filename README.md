We are two persons and we have a drink bottle that we want to share

### Solution 1

We cut the bottle in half. 

Problem: the liquid will fall out the bottle

Problem: we have to travel to Canada in order to do it: we put the bottle in the freezing weather 

### Solution 3 

- We can buy another bottle of drink just like it
- Empty the bottle 
- Drop half of the drink from the first bottle into the second
