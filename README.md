# Crazy very out the box ideas

## 1- Drink bottle sharing problem

### Problem 

We are two persons and we have a drink bottle that we want to share

### Solution 1

We cut the bottle in half. 

Problem: the liquid will fall out the bottle

### Solution 2 

We have to freeze the drink before cutting the bottle

Problem: we have to travel to Canada in order to do it: we put the bottle in the freezing weather 

### Solution 3 

- We can buy another bottle of drink just like it
- Empty the bottle 
- Drop half of the drink from the first bottle into the second

## 1- Picnic problem

### Problem 

We are a group of friends who want to go on a picnic to the woods. There is a high chance it will rain that day, and we insist on eating lunch outside. 

### Solution 1

Cancel and reprogram for another day

Problem: Nah! we insist 

### Solution 2 

Take a chainsaw and build a cabine in which we can eat our lunch

Problem: we will have problems with environmental activists  

### Solution 3 

- Take a table 
- If it rains, we put the food under the table along with our heads and eat
